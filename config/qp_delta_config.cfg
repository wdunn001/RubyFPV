# QP Delta Configuration
# QP Delta is like a 'quality dial' for your video encoder
# Lower values = better quality, higher bandwidth usage
# Higher values = lower quality, less bandwidth usage

# Enable/disable QP Delta system
# 0 = disabled (no QP delta adjustment)
# 1 = enabled (apply QP delta based on bitrate/MCS)
enable_qp_delta=1

# QP Delta for Low Bitrate (MCS 1-2)
# Applied when bitrate is low (1-3 Mbps)
# Higher values = more compression, lower quality
# Lower values = less compression, higher quality
# Recommended: 10-25 for FPV applications
qp_delta_low=15

# QP Delta for Medium Bitrate (MCS 3-9)
# Applied when bitrate is medium (3-15 Mbps)
# Higher values = more compression, lower quality
# Lower values = less compression, higher quality
# Recommended: 3-10 for FPV applications
qp_delta_medium=5

# QP Delta for High Bitrate (MCS 10+)
# Applied when bitrate is high (15+ Mbps)
# Higher values = more compression, lower quality
# Lower values = less compression, higher quality
# Recommended: 0-5 for FPV applications
qp_delta_high=0

# QP Delta Presets (for reference)
# Racing Mode:     low=10,  medium=3,  high=0
# Long Range:      low=25,  medium=10, high=5
# Balanced:        low=15,  medium=5,  high=0
# Maximum Quality: low=0,   medium=0,  high=0

# How QP Delta Works:
# - QP (Quantization Parameter) controls video compression
# - Lower QP = better quality, more bandwidth
# - Higher QP = lower quality, less bandwidth
# - QP Delta adjusts QP based on current bitrate/MCS
# - Dynamic adjustment helps maintain consistent quality
# - Prevents quality drops during bitrate changes
