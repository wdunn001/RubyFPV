# Dynamic RSSI Threshold Configuration
# This system replaces static RSSI thresholds with MCS-based dynamic thresholds
# that adapt to the current modulation scheme for better signal management.

# Enable/disable dynamic RSSI threshold system
# 0 = disabled (use static thresholds)
# 1 = enabled (use dynamic MCS-based thresholds)
enable_dynamic_thresholds=1

# Hardware-specific RSSI offset calibration (dBm)
# This compensates for hardware variations between different builds
# Positive values = hardware is more sensitive (lower threshold needed)
# Negative values = hardware is less sensitive (higher threshold needed)
# Default: 0 (no offset)
hardware_rssi_offset=0

# Safety margin for emergency drops (dBm)
# Additional margin added to dynamic thresholds for emergency drop detection
# Higher values = more conservative (earlier emergency drops)
# Lower values = more aggressive (later emergency drops)
# Recommended: 3-5 dBm for FPV applications
safety_margin_db=3

# MCS to RSSI Threshold Mapping (read-only, for reference)
# MCS 0 (BPSK 1/2):   -82 dBm (most robust)
# MCS 1 (QPSK 1/2):   -79 dBm
# MCS 2 (QPSK 3/4):   -77 dBm
# MCS 3 (16-QAM 1/2): -74 dBm
# MCS 4 (16-QAM 3/4): -70 dBm
# MCS 5 (64-QAM 2/3):  -66 dBm
# MCS 6 (64-QAM 3/4):  -65 dBm
# MCS 7 (64-QAM 5/6):  -64 dBm
# MCS 8 (256-QAM 3/4): -59 dBm (VHT)
# MCS 9 (256-QAM 5/6): -57 dBm (VHT, least robust)
